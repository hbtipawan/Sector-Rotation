# PKC Sector Radar

A free, ScreeningMantis-style dashboard for NSE stocks:

- **Rotation** – theme / sector / NSE-index returns for Today, 1W, 1M, 3M, 6M, YTD, 1Y, with mean or median, rank change vs last week, and a click-through list of the stocks in each group.
- **Breadth** – % of stocks above 20/50/200 DMA, advance/decline, 52-week highs/lows, 4% movers, one year of history.
- **RS ranking** – every stock ranked 1–99 by relative strength, filterable by sector, theme, Stage 2, Minervini trend template.
- **Scanners** – 59 scans in 9 groups (`scripts/scanners.py`), led by a **Confluence** list (stocks firing in 4+ of the 7 bullish groups). Momentum (4% day, burst, gap-up, RS jump, power trend, ants, high-octane, 3/6/12-month swing leaders, episodic pivot, buyable gap-up), breakouts (52-week / 2-year / all-time highs, strong-close highs, Darvas, Bollinger, Stage 2, VCP, 3 weeks tight, launch pad, IPO high), volume, trend & pullbacks (incl. power of 3, wedge pop), price action (outside day, open = low, hammer at 50 DMA, double inside day, bull snort), oscillators, RS-line new highs (1/3/6/12 months) and weakness (incl. leader down on volume). Any scan can be limited to the top 5 or 10 themes.
- **Watchlists** – multiple lists, return since added, pivot/stop/target with buy-zone alerts, notes, flags, track record, import/export, phone ↔ PC sync.
- **VPCI Screener** – your Streamlit screener (`vpci/` folder, files unchanged) run every evening: Fresh Signals, Buyable, Watchlist, All Results, Ranked, G4 Pending, New Listings, Sector Leadership, Sector Rotation — for both completed weeks and the running week.

**No broker login, no API key, no password.** Prices come from Upstox's public historical-candle service, which answers without an account. Today's candle is added from NSE's official bhavcopy. Yahoo Finance is wired in as a backup.

Cost: ₹0. Setup: about 20 minutes, once.

---

## Step 1 — Try it on your PC (optional, 10 minutes)

1. Install Python 3.12 from python.org (tick "Add Python to PATH").
2. Unzip this folder, e.g. to `D:\sector-radar`.
3. Double-click `run_local.bat`. It downloads all ~2,900 NSE stocks (about 6 minutes), computes everything and opens the site at http://localhost:8000.

Quick 20-stock test instead: open Command Prompt in the folder and run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts\fetch_prices.py --limit 20
```

## Step 2 — Put it on GitHub

1. Create a free account at github.com.
2. Click **New repository** → name it `sector-radar` → choose **Private** or **Public** (see Step 3) → Create.
3. On the empty repo page click **uploading an existing file** and drag in everything from the folder. Make sure the `.github` folder goes in too (on Windows, turn on "show hidden items" if you can't see it). Commit.
4. Go to **Actions** → enable workflows if asked → **Daily update** → **Run workflow**. It takes about 10 minutes. A green tick means `docs/data` now holds fresh data.

From now on it runs by itself at 6:40 PM IST every weekday. There are no secrets to add. A private repo gets 2,000 free Action minutes a month; this uses about 250.

## Step 3 — Host the website (free)

There is nothing secret in the repo, so pick based on who may see the dashboard:

**Public, simplest (2 minutes).** Make the repo public → **Settings → Pages** → Source: *Deploy from a branch* → Branch: `main`, folder `/docs` → Save. Your site is at `https://<your-username>.github.io/sector-radar/`. Anyone with the link can view it.

**Private, only you.** GitHub Pages needs a paid plan for private repos, so use Cloudflare Pages:
1. Free account at dash.cloudflare.com.
2. **Workers & Pages → Create → Pages → Connect to Git** → pick `sector-radar`.
3. Framework preset: **None**. Build command: empty. Build output directory: `docs`. Deploy.
4. You get a link like `sector-radar-xyz.pages.dev`. Each evening's data commit redeploys it.
5. Lock it to you: **Zero Trust → Access → Applications → Add → Self-hosted**, enter the pages.dev address, allow only your email.

## Step 4 — Edit themes

Themes live in `config/themes.csv`: one theme per row, NSE symbols separated by spaces.

```
Theme,Symbols
Wires & Cables,POLYCAB KEI FINCABLES RRKABEL HAVELLS ...
```

Edit it on GitHub (open the file → pencil icon → commit). A theme appears once 3 of its stocks pass the filters. The next daily run picks up changes; to see them immediately, run the workflow by hand.

**Sector** comes from NSE's classification of the ~750 Nifty Total Market stocks. **NSE Index** groups are equal-weighted members of 39 sectoral and thematic indices. Both refresh automatically.

## Optional — Industry for every stock and the ₹500 Cr filter

BSE blocks cloud servers, but its public company list works from a home connection and has every company's industry and market cap:

```
python scripts\pc_bse_industry.py
```

Upload the `config/industry_bse.csv` it writes to `config/` on GitHub. From the next run you get an **Industry** tab covering all stocks, and stocks below ₹500 Cr are dropped. Re-run monthly.

Without it, the universe is filtered by liquidity: price ≥ ₹20 and median daily turnover ≥ ₹1 Cr over 50 days (about 1,550 stocks).

## Watchlists

Tap **☆** next to any stock name (Rotation, RS ranking, Scanners, VPCI, stock card) to put it in one or more lists. The **Watchlists** tab then shows, per list:

- **Since added** — price and NIFTY 500 level are recorded on the day you add a stock: return since added, return vs NIFTY, days on the list, best gain and worst dip since added, 3-month sparkline. The added date/price can be edited (change the date and the price fills in from that day's close).
- **Your levels** — pivot (buy-above), stop, target, flag colour and a note. Setup column: below pivot / near pivot / **buy zone** (pivot to +5%, IBD) / extended / below stop / target hit. Risk %, reward/risk and a position-size calculator from your risk per trade.
- **Needs your attention today** — stop hit, breakout above your pivot, buy zone, near pivot or stop, target reached, warnings (4% breakdown, lost 50 DMA, RS falling below 70, red flags), new hits in key scans, results due within 7 days, fresh VPCI signals. The tab shows a count of urgent items.
- Columns: Tracking / Performance / Fundamentals; sort and CSV like every table.
- **Track record** — removed stocks are logged with their return and return vs NIFTY, giving your hit rate.
- Import (paste symbols, TradingView `.txt`, Kite lists), export to TradingView, backup file, share link, and **☆ Add all** on every scanner.

Watchlists are saved in your browser. **Sync devices** keeps phone and PC identical through a secret GitHub gist: create a token with only the `gist` permission (the button links to the right GitHub page), paste it once on each device. The first connect on a device that already has lists merges both.

`compute.py` also writes `docs/data/closes.json` (one year of daily closes, ~0.8 MB compressed) for the sparklines, back-dated adds and the 12-month chart in every stock card.

## Long-base identifier

The **Long bases** tab lists every stock that is in a base on the daily chart, sorted by how many trading days it has been there.

- **Definition.** A base is the stretch a stock has spent below a closing high (the **pivot**) without falling more than 50% below it. All of it is measured on daily closes, so one wick does not move the pivot.
- **Where the count starts.** After an advance, it starts at the left-side high: the first close within 5% of the pivot. If the stock fell into the base, it starts at the bar after the last close above the pivot. The advance or decline that led into the base is not counted.
- **What each stock shows:**
  - base days (and years), the start date, pivot, base low and depth;
  - where the price is (breakout, back at the pivot, extended, within 5%, 5–15% below, deeper);
  - how many times the pivot was tested;
  - the last-15-day range (tightness) and volume dry-up;
  - up/down volume, an older high above the pivot (overhead supply), and the next pivot above;
  - a measured-move target (pivot + 85% of the base height);
  - a breakout from a shorter base inside the long one in the last 20 sessions;
  - a mini chart.
- **Stock card.** It shows the same with a large chart and the Base Score broken down.
- **Base Score (0–100), built from the backtest:**

  | Part | Points |
  |---|---|
  | Base length (most for 200–399 days, then 400–799) | 25 |
  | RS rating | 25 |
  | Uptrend (above a rising 150-day and the 200-day average) | 20 |
  | Tight right side | 15 |
  | Built after an advance | 10 |
  | Little overhead supply | 5 |

- **Three scanners in the Scanners tab, under Bases:**
  - Long-base breakout (100+ days)
  - Long base near pivot (200+ days)
  - Big base with a top score
  - The first two also feed watchlist alerts and the Telegram digest.

**Checked on 20 years of NSE data** (Oct 2006 – Oct 2026, about 59,000 breakouts, returns 1 year after the breakout against NIFTY 500). The full tables are in the tab under "What 20 years of NSE data say" and in `config/base_evidence.json`.

- **Length alone did not predict a bigger move.** In an uptrend with RS 70+ it did: 200–399-day bases beat the index by about 20% on average against 11% for 25–49-day bases. Outside an uptrend, long bases gave no edge.
- **The Base Score sorted outcomes in both halves of the period.** It ran from about +3% under 40 to about +17% at 80+.
- **Caveat.** Only stocks still listed today are included.

**Data.**
- `fetch_prices.py` now downloads `base_history_calendar_days` (2,300 days, about 6 years) in the same single request per stock. Everything else still uses the usual 760-day window, so all other numbers are unchanged.
- `fetch_bse_backfill.py` adds the older BSE closes for stocks that moved from BSE to NSE recently, so their bases are not cut at the NSE listing. Stocks with no older BSE data are remembered in `config/bse_skip.csv`.
- The detection code is `scripts/bases.py`. It uses numba and runs in a few seconds.

## Stage 2: early, mid or late

**Scanners → Stage 2: early · mid · late** lists every stock in Stage 2 — the same stocks the Stage column marks as Stage 2, i.e. above a 150-day (30-week) line that rose 1%+ in 20 sessions. Each stock gets a **phase** and a **Stage 2 Score**. The list is sorted Early → Mid → Late, highest score first within each phase.

- **When the advance started:** the first Stage 2 day after the last confirmed Stage 4 (10 of 20 sessions below a falling 150-day line).
- **Phase points (0–9):**
  - O'Neil base count since the start, 0–4. A base counts after a 20%+ gain from the last counted pivot, and undercutting the previous base's low restarts the count at 1. Two bases = 1 point, three = 2, four = 3, five or more = 4.
  - Months in Stage 2, 0–2: 6–12 months = 1, over 12 months = 2.
  - Gain from the low before the start, 0–2: 150–300% = 1, over 300% = 2.
  - 150-day slope slowing, 0–1.
  - **Early** 0–1 · **Mid** 2–4 · **Late** 5+.
- **Stage 2 Score (0–100):**

  | Part | Points |
  |---|---|
  | RS | 25 |
  | 150-day slope | 20 |
  | Close to the advance's peak | 20 |
  | Above the 150-day (30–100% best) | 15 |
  | Above the 50-day | 10 |
  | Highest close in 6 years | 10 |

- **Warnings:** below the 50-day, 15%+ off the peak, slope slowing, and climax (100%+ above the 200-day).
- **Two scanners:** "Early Stage 2, score 70+" (also used in watchlist alerts and Telegram) and "Late Stage 2, weakening".

**Checked on 20 years of NSE data** (119,000 Stage 2 snapshots, 2006–2026; full tables in the tab and in `config/stage2_evidence.json`):

- **Late phase:** more risk in both halves of the period. 25–29% fell into Stage 4 within 6 months, against 17–19% for Early, and drawdowns were deeper. Lower returns showed up only in 2017–26 (+2.7% a year over NIFTY 500 vs +13.3% for Early); in 2007–16 there was no return gap.
- **Distance above the moving averages** turned out to be bullish rather than a warning, so it is not counted as lateness.
- **Best group:** Early with a score of 70+ (+23% a year, 6% fell into Stage 4). **Worst:** Late with a score under 55 (+1.5%, 40% fell into Stage 4).

The code is `scripts/stage2.py`. It uses the long-base breakouts from `bases.py` to count bases.

## Telegram alerts

Two kinds of message, both sent by your own Telegram bot:

- **Evening digest** (after each daily update, ~6:50 PM): NIFTY 500 and breadth verdict, top themes, every watchlist alert from the Watchlists tab (stop, breakout, buy zone, near pivot, target, warnings, results due, fresh VPCI) and today's key scanner hits, with TradingView links.
- **Live alerts** (every 15 minutes, 9:15 AM–3:30 PM on weekdays): for each stock in your watchlists, today's live price from Upstox is checked against your levels — **crossed your pivot** (with volume pace vs the 50-day average and an "extended" warning above +5%), **within 1% of pivot**, **below your stop**, **target hit**, and **±5% move today**. Each alert is sent once per stock per day.

Setup (10 minutes, once):

1. In Telegram open **@BotFather** → `/newbot` → give it any name and a username ending in `bot`. Copy the token it gives you.
2. Open your new bot and press **Start** (or send it "hi") — a bot can only message you after you've messaged it.
3. Repository → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**:
   - `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` = the BotFather token
   - `GIST_TOKEN` = the same `ghp_…` token you pasted in **Sync devices** (Sync must be on — that's how the bot sees your lists and levels)
4. **Actions → Telegram live alerts → Run workflow** (mode `test`). Open the run: the log shows `YOUR TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID IS: …`. Add that number as a third secret, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`.
5. Run it again with mode `test` — you get a "connected" message listing how many lists and levels it found.

Optional: a variable (same page, **Variables** tab) `SITE_URL` with your dashboard address if it isn't `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`; `MOVE_PCT` changes the 5% move alert.

Notes: GitHub can start scheduled runs 5–15 minutes late on busy days, so treat these as a heads-up — keep real stop-loss / GTT orders in Kite. Live alerts cover NSE stocks (BSE-only names get the evening digest only). Without the secrets the workflow simply skips. Which alerts were already sent is kept in the same secret gist (`pkc-radar-alert-state.json`).

## Fundamentals (automatic, from NSE filings)

`scripts/fetch_fundamentals.py` reads the companies' own quarterly filings on NSE every evening — no login, no uploads:

- **Quarterly results** (about 10 quarters per stock): revenue, every expense line, profit before tax, net profit attributable to shareholders, EPS; balance sheet and cash flow from the half-year (Sep) and year-end (Mar) filings.
- **Shareholding pattern** (latest 5+ quarters): promoter, FII, DII, mutual funds, retail, number of shareholders.
- **Results calendar** (board meetings for the next 60 days) and **industry** (Yahoo Finance classification).

The first run downloads everything (~35,000 small files, about 45 min); after that each run fetches only filings published since the previous one, usually a few minutes. Data is kept in `config/fund_results.csv`, `config/fund_holdings.csv` and `config/fund_info.csv`.

`scripts/fundamentals.py` turns this into: profit and revenue growth (YoY, QoQ, trailing four quarters), three-quarter earnings acceleration, operating margin and its change, P/E, P/S and PEG on today's market cap, ROE, ROCE, debt/equity, free cash flow, CWIP share of assets, and shareholding changes over 1 quarter and 1 year. A **Fund rating 1–99** (70% growth, 30% quality, percentile across the universe; loss-makers capped low) sits next to the RS rating, and every scanner can be limited to Fund 60+ or 80+.

Fundamental scanners: growth leaders 25/25, earnings acceleration, CANSLIM-style, SEPA, margin expansion, revenue streak, turnaround, post-results breakout, results in the next 7 days, quality compounders, GARP, capex cycle, net-cash small caps, smart-money accumulation, mutual funds moving in, promoter buying, under-followed leaders, and fundamental red flags.

Banks and lenders skip margin, ROCE, debt and cash-flow tests. Growth is only computed from a profitable base.

## VPCI Screener

`vpci/` holds your screener exactly as in the `rojiroti` repo (`app.py`, `vpci_engine.py`, `data_sources.py`, `signal_history.py`, `sector_history.py`, `Stock_List.csv`). `scripts/vpci_app_run.py` does what clicking **Run Market Scan** does, with the app's defaults (Upstox → Yahoo, relaxed off, 12 workers), twice: once with "Screen the RUNNING week" off and once on (volume pro-rated). It reads its functions straight from `vpci/app.py`, so when you change the screener, copy the new files into `vpci/` and the website follows.

Checked against the real app: running `app.py` through Streamlit's test harness on 140 stocks gave identical values in every column, the same statuses and the same market caps.

Kite isn't used here (it needs a fresh token every day). Sector-rotation history is saved as one snapshot per week in `docs/data/vpci/history/`.

## Settings

`config/settings.json`:

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `base_history_calendar_days` | 2300 | Days of daily candles downloaded for the long-base identifier (everything else uses `history_calendar_days`, 760) |
| `min_price` | 20 | Ignore stocks below this price |
| `min_median_turnover_cr` | 1.0 | Median 50-day traded value, ₹ crore |
| `min_market_cap_cr` | 500 | Used only if `industry_bse.csv` or `mcap.csv` exists |
| `min_group_size` | 3 | Smallest group shown on the Rotation tab |
| `include_series` | EQ, BE | NSE series included |
| `upstox_requests_per_second` | 10 | Download speed; lower it if you ever see refusals |

## How the numbers are calculated

- **Prices** are adjusted for splits and bonuses (checked: HDFC Bank's 1:1 bonus and Bajaj Finance's split show no jumps). Upstox closes and volumes matched NSE's bhavcopy exactly for all 2,912 stocks tested.
- **Group return** = equal-weighted mean (or median) of member stocks' returns. Rank arrows compare with the same calculation 5 sessions ago.
- **RS rating** = percentile (1–99) of 0.4 × 3-month + 0.2 × 6-month + 0.2 × 9-month + 0.2 × 12-month performance.
- **Stage** = price vs the 150-day SMA (30-week) and its 20-day slope: above and rising = Stage 2, below and falling = Stage 4.
- **Trend template** = Minervini's 8 conditions with RS ≥ 70.
- **Darvas breakout** = prior 20-session range ≤ 15%, close above its high, volume ≥ 1.5× the 50-day average.
- **Breadth** uses today's universe for the whole history.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Actions run is red | Open it and read the step that failed. If Upstox failed, the Yahoo step should have run instead. |
| Site says "Data files could not be loaded" | The workflow hasn't succeeded yet — check the Actions tab. |
| Today's candle missing | NSE publishes the bhavcopy around 6 PM; on rare late days the run uses Upstox's own end-of-day candle. Run the workflow again later if needed. |
| Want data now | Actions → Daily update → Run workflow (choose `yahoo` if Upstox is down). |
| Workflow stopped running | GitHub pauses schedules after 60 days without repo activity on public repos. The daily data commit counts as activity, so this only happens if runs keep failing. |

## A note on the data source

Upstox's historical-candle endpoint is meant for its API users, and it currently answers without a login. That could change without notice; if it does, the job falls back to Yahoo automatically and you'll see "Yahoo (backup)" in the site header. Keep the dashboard for personal use; don't resell the data.
